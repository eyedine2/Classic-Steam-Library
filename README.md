# This theme does not work in the Steam Beta. It only works on the stable branch of Steam!

Returns the Steam library to it's 2013 and 2015 era looks with CSS tweaks instead of reverting it.
<br>
This is a large scale and somewhat messy project that has taken place over the course of several years. Things are not perfect here, but you probably aren't here for that.

        <h2>A Complete Rework</h2>
        <p>Almost every panel has been given a complete makeover, looking more in line with the Steam we used to know. Every part of the library, friends list, and even some parts of the Store and Community pages have been touched in some way.</p>

## Trimming the Fat
Poorly performing and visually noisy areas of the vanilla client have been smoothed over. No longer will your system be assaulted by achievement spam! Certain "Problem games" (Such as PAYDAY 2) used to add thousands of elements to facilitate poorly thought out community features. All of this has been removed. Everything is repositioned to maximize both space and content on screen in a sensible way. Gone are the distracting game banners that hide crucial features for aesthetic purposes. Everything unnecessary is out of the way or straight up gone â€” as they should be.

## The Activity Feed, Rethought!
What was once a hub of useless spam is now a re-envisioned version of the old "News" panel. All of your game's updates, now in one place! I mean, it's not like you actually use the "What's New" shelf... right?

## Installation (manual installation)
Drop the theme in the `skins` folder inside `steamui`. Inside the skins folder should be a few folders (2013steam, 2015steam) and loose files (libraryroot.custom.css, etc), the theme should **NOT** be in a folder called "Classic-Steam-Library-main". Once that's done, Leave SFP patching. Do not close it.
